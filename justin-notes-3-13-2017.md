  * Justin and Chad looking into adopting Angular2, first project will be building a template for forms
* Day in the Life of a Raleigh Trash Truck
  * Use AVL history of a trash truck to display using The Day in the Life of a NYC Taxi app
* Possible integration of Cityworks and Workforce for ArcGIS
  * Justin did a demo of Workforce for ArcGIS that is being used for inspecting streetcut permits
